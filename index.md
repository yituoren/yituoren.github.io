Here is **Rui Zhao (Terry, 赵睿)**.<br>

I am a undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, currently under the guidance of  [Prof. Hongning Wang](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/directory/akan). I also spent a lovely SRT program with [Postdoc Songjie Niu](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) studying LLM-based knowledge graph automated construction. <br>

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning**
- Machine Learning
- Embodied Intelligence
- Large (Language) Model

My current research focuses on practical issues that artificial intelligence faces. I don't think current methods that are widely used can lead to real intelligence, considering the problems of real-world understanding, thinking and energy consumption. I wish to devote my talent to explaining and finding the way to artificial intelligence and change the world a little bit.
