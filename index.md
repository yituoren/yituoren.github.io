## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning**
- Machine Learning
- Embodied Intelligence
- Large (Language) Model

My current research focuses on practical issues that artificial intelligence faces. I do not think current methods that are widely used can lead to real intelligence, considering the problems of real-world understanding, thinking and energy consumption. I wish to devote my talent to explaining and finding the way to artificial intelligence and change the world a little bit.
